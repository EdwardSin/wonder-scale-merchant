2.2  Account Manager.  The Account Manager specified on the Cover Page will be the primary point of contact to assist Customer with various operational activities under this Agreement.

2.3  Insertion Order.  For each Advertisement that Customer wishes to place, Customer will provide Advertisement duration, Media, budget, and other relevant information to Wonder Scale.  Wonder Scale will then propose a placement solution in an Insertion Order in a form similar to Attachment 1 of this Agreement.  The price specified in the proposed Insertion Order will be valid for seven days from the date of issuance (“Insertion Order Deadline”).  An Insertion Order will take effect only if Customer, by the Insertion Order Deadline, executes and delivers the Insertion Order to Wonder Scale at the material submission email address set forth on the Insertion Order, which delivery can be made electronically by email.  All Insertion Orders will be governed by these Terms and Conditions, and if there is any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and an Insertion Order, these Terms and Conditions will prevail, unless the Insertion Order explicitly provides that its terms will take precedence over specific sections of these Terms and Conditions.  

2.4  Submission of Advertising Materials.  Customer will submit to Wonder Scale at the material submission email address set forth on each Insertion Order all Advertising Materials and any related Landing Page for each Advertisement by the submission deadline set forth on the applicable Insertion Order.  If any Advertising Material or Landing Page is not provided in accordance with this Agreement, Wonder Scale cannot guarantee that it will deliver the corresponding Advertisement by the launch date of the Advertisement specified on the applicable Insertion Order.

2.5  Cancellation and Change Orders.  Wonder Scale may cancel an Insertion Order at any time. Customer may cancel an Insertion Order at any time, which cancellation will take effect three business days after Wonder Scale’s receipt of Customer’s written cancellation request.  Customer remains obligated to pay the Advertising Fee (and applicable taxes as specified in the Insertion Order) resulting from Advertisements served before the cancellation takes effect.   No later than three business days before the launch date of an Advertisement, if Customer requests a change to the applicable Insertion Order and Wonder Scale approves that request, Wonder Scale will prepare a revised Insertion Order, which may include a price adjustment.  A revised Insertion Order may delay the launch of the Advertisement and will not take effect until Customer executes and delivers the revised Insertion Order to Wonder Scale by the deadline to the email address specified on the revised Insertion Order. 

 

3.  COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT TERMS

3.1  Advertising Fee.  Upon execution of an Insertion Order, Customer shall deposit the advertising fee for such Insertion Order ("Advertising Fee”) with Wonder Scale as soon as practicable. Customer’s failure to ensure such deposit is received by Wonder Scale before the launch date of the Advertisement will be deemed a cancellation as specified in Section 2.5.  All Advertising Fees are non-refundable.

3.2  Advertising Fee and Invoice.

(a)          Following Wonder Scale’s receipt of the executed Insertion Order, Wonder Scale will issue Customer an invoice reflecting the Advertising Fee and any applicable taxes. 

(b)          Upon receiving the invoice, Customer shall deposit the advertising fee for such Insertion Order with Wonder Scale by the date indicated in the invoice. All Advertising Fees are non-refundable.

(c)          If any amount due to Wonder Scale remains unpaid after the due date, Wonder Scale shall be entitled, without limiting any other rights it may have, to charge interest on the outstanding amount at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the due date until such outstanding amount is paid in full.  Wonder Scale shall have the right to suspend, withhold or discontinue the advertisements until the full payment of the outstanding amount and the interest thereon are received by Wonder Scale.

(d)          Except as otherwise set forth in an Insertion Order, all payments made by Customer to Wonder Scale under this Agreement will not include any taxes.  Each party will pay all taxes that it owes under this Agreement.

11.2  Independent Contractor.  This Agreement will not be construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship or as granting a franchise.  The parties are independent contractors in the performance of this Agreement.  Neither party is authorized to bind the other party to any liability or obligation or to represent that it has any authority to do so.

11.3  Press Release.  Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or as required by the laws of any jurisdiction, neither party will make any public announcement or press release regarding the cooperation contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent of the other party.

The deadline for fulfilling the obligation in question will be extended for a period equal to that of the continuance of the Force Majeure event.

11.5  Governing Law and Resolution of Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Malaysia. In the event of any dispute, controversy, claim or difference of any kind whatsoever arising between the parties in connection with this Agreement, including the breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, or in connection with the determination of any matters which are subject to objective determination pursuant to this Agreement (“Dispute”), which Dispute has been subject of a written notice by one party to the other (“Dispute Notice”), the parties shall attempt, for a period of thirty (30) days after the receipt by one (1) party of a notice from the other party of the existence of a Dispute, to settle such Dispute in the first instance by mutual discussions between the senior management of each of the parties. If the Dispute cannot be settled by mutual discussions within the thirty (30) day period, it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Asian International Arbitration Centre in Kuala Lumpur in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Asian International Arbitration Centre (“AIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.

Customer may not voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement (in whole or in part), including by direct or indirect change of control, merger (whether or not Customer is the surviving entity), or operation of law, without Wonder Scale’s prior written consent, which Wonder Scale may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion.   Any direct or indirect change of control of equity ownership or management or control of Customer, whether or not Customer survives as an entity, will be deemed an assignment and delegation of this Agreement that requires Wonder Scale’s prior written consent.  An assignment by Customer will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Agreement and any Insertion Order unless Wonder Scale expressly states otherwise in its written consent.  Wonder Scale will not release Customer of its liability under this Agreement and any Insertion Order unless Wonder Scale expressly states otherwise in its written consent.  Wonder Scale may voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement or any Insertion Order (in whole or in part) without Customer’s consent.  Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 11.7 will be null and void.  Subject to this Section 11.7, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party’s respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

11.8  Waiver.  Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement or of a party’s rights or remedies under this Agreement must be in writing provided in accordance with Section 11.6 to be effective.  Failure, neglect, or delay by a party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time will not be construed as a waiver of the party’s rights under this Agreement and will not in any way affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice the party’s right to take subsequent action.  Exercise or enforcement by either party of any right or remedy under this Agreement will not preclude the enforcement by the party of any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that the party is entitled by law to enforce.

11.9  Severability.  If any term, condition, or provision in this Agreement is found to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable to any extent, the parties will endeavor in good faith to agree to amendments that will preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this Agreement.  If the parties fail to agree on an amendment, the invalid term, condition, or provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement, which will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the tribunal will preserve, as far as possible, the original intention of the parties with respect to the severed term, condition, or provision.

11.10  Remedies Cumulative.  No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise of any other right or remedy.  Rights and remedies provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any right or remedy provided at law or in equity.

11.11  Confidentiality of Agreement.  Customer will not disclose any terms of this Agreement to any third party without Wonder Scale’s prior written consent, except as required by applicable law.

11.12  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original and together will constitute one and the same agreement.

These Terms and Conditions, together with the Cover Page, and all Insertion Orders, constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all previous communications, representations, understandings, and agreements, either oral or written, between the parties with respect to that subject matter.  No terms, provisions, or conditions of any purchase order, acknowledgement, or other business form that either party may use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will have any effect on the rights, duties, or obligations of the parties under, or otherwise modify, this Agreement, regardless of any failure of a receiving party to object to these terms, provisions, or conditions.  These terms and conditions may be amended by Wonder Scale at any time.
